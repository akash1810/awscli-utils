# awscli-utils

A collection of awscli commands I find myself typing over and over.

Requires the awscli:

```sh
pip install awscli
```

and jq:

```sh
brew install jq
```

# Usage

Its easiest to add the `bin` directory to your path:

```sh
echo 'export PATH="/path/to/awscli-utils/bin/:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
```
